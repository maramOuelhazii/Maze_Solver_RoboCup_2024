# Maze_Solver_RoboCup_2024
The robot navigates a maze-like disaster environment using DFS, detects letter and color victims via Raspberry Pi, deploys rescue kits, avoids hazards, handles obstacles, restarts from checkpoints if stuck, and returns to start for exit bonuses, operating fully autonomously.
